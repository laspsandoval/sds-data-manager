    This always returns an incremented version. We don't need dependencies here

    The duplicate detection works like this: a job is skipped only if BOTH the
    dependency_hash AND container_image_digest are identical to a previous
    INPROGRESS or SUCCEEDED job. If either the hash changes or the image digest changes
    (due to a new software version), a new job submission is allowed with a bumped

    1. in-process jobs from the processing table
